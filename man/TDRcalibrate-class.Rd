\title{Class "TDRcalibrate" for dive analysis}
\description{
This class holds information produced at various stages of dive
analysis.  Methods are provided for extracting data from each slot.
}
\details{
This is perhaps the most important class in diveMove, as it holds all
the information necessary for calculating requested summaries for a
TDR.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{call}}{Object of class \code{\link{call}}.  The matched call to the
function that created the object.}

\item{\code{tdr}}{Object of class \code{\link{TDR}}.  This slot contains the
time, zero-offset corrected depth, and possibly a data frame.  If
the object is also of class "TDRspeed", then the data frame might
contain calibrated or uncalibrated speed.  See
\code{\link{readTDR}} and the accessor function
\code{\link{getTDR}} for this slot.}

\item{\code{gross.activity}}{Object of class \sQuote{list}. This slot holds a
list of the form returned by \code{\link{.detPhase}}, composed of 4
elements.  It contains a vector (named \code{phase.id}) numbering
each major activity phase found in the record, a factor (named
\code{activity}) labelling each row as being dry, wet, or trivial
wet activity.  These two elements are as long as there are rows in
\code{tdr}.  This list also contains two more vectors, named
\code{begin} and \code{end}: one with the beginning time of each
phase, and another with the ending time; both represented as
\code{\link{POSIXct}} objects. See \code{\link{.detPhase}}.}

\item{\code{dive.activity}}{Object of class \code{\link{data.frame}}.  This
slot contains a \code{\link{data.frame}} of the form returned by
\code{\link{.detDive}}, with as many rows as those in \code{tdr},
consisting of three vectors named: \code{dive.id}, which is an
integer vector, sequentially numbering each dive (rows that are not
part of a dive are labelled 0), dive.activity is a factor which
completes that in \code{activity} above, further identifying rows
in the record belonging to a dive.  The third vector in
\code{dive.activity} is an integer vector sequentially numbering
each postdive interval (all rows that belong to a dive are labelled
0).  See \code{\link{.detDive}}, and \code{\link{getDAct}} to
access all or any one of these vectors.}

\item{\code{dive.phases}}{Object of class \sQuote{factor}.  This slot is a
factor that labels each row in the record as belonging to a
particular phase of a dive.  It has the same form as the
\dQuote{phase.labels} component of the list returned by
\code{\link{.labDivePhase}}.}

\item{\code{dive.models}}{Object of class \sQuote{list}.  This slot contains
the details of the process of dive phase identification for each
dive.  It has the same form as the \code{dive.models} component of
the list returned by \code{\link{.labDivePhase}}.  It has as many
components as there are dives in the \code{\link{TDR}} object, each
of them of class \code{\link{diveModel}}.}

\item{\code{dry.thr}}{Object of class \sQuote{numeric}.  The temporal criteria
used for detecting dry periods that should be considered as wet.}

\item{\code{wet.thr}}{Object of class \sQuote{numeric} the temporal criteria
used for detecting periods wet that should not be considered as
foraging time.}

\item{\code{dive.thr}}{Object of class \sQuote{numeric}.  The temporal criteria
used for detecting periods wet that should not be considered as
foraging time.}

\item{\code{speed.calib.coefs}}{Object of class \sQuote{numeric}.  The
intercept and slope derived from the speed calibration procedure.
Defaults to c(0, 1) meaning uncalibrated speeds.}
}}

\section{Objects from the Class}{


Objects can be created by calls of the form \code{new("TDRcalibrate",
\dots{})}.  The objects of this class contain information necessary to
divide the record into sections (e.g.  dry/water), dive/surface, and
different sections within dives.  They also contain the parameters used
to calibrate speed and criteria to divide the record into phases.
