  rddepth,
  speed,
  z,
  contours,
  rqFit,
  main = "qtRegression",
  xlab = "rate of depth change (m/s)",

}
\arguments{
\item{rddepth}{numeric vector with rate of depth change.}

\item{speed}{numeric vector with speed in m/s.}

\item{z}{list with the bivariate kernel density estimates (1st
component the x points of the mesh, 2nd the y points, and 3rd the
matrix of densities).}

\item{contours}{list with components: \code{pts} which should be a
matrix with columns named \code{x} and \code{y}, \code{level} a
number indicating the contour level the points in \code{pts}
correspond to.}

\item{rqFit}{object of class \dQuote{rq} representing a quantile
regression fit of rate of depth change on mean speed.}

\item{main}{character: string with title prefix to include in ouput
plot.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{character vectors with axis labels.}

\item{colramp}{function taking an integer n as an argument and
returning n colors.}

\item{col.line}{color to use for the regression line.}

\item{cex.pts}{numeric: value specifying the amount by which to enlarge
the size of points.}

\description{
Plot of quantile regression for assessing quality of speed calibrations
}
\details{
The dashed line in the plot represents a reference indicating a one to
one relationship between speed and rate of depth change.  The other
line represent the quantile regression fit.
